Like if something comes in which we have to give a function call then what we will have to do is like use &

As in function if we use (vector<int>abc);

It is O(N) in itself 

So we should use (vector<int>&abc).

Question 2
Trapping Rainwater

Question 3

Gap method (Given an array sort it and find maximum difference b/w A[i] and A[i+1])

Question 1

Given a matrix sorted like both rows and columns find an element x.


Question 2
Majority element >= (n/2)

Question 3
Majority element >= (n/3)

Class 3 Summary (Two Pointers)

First concept of sieve of eratothenes.

In sieve of eratothenes what we have to do is like 

Case 1 if we want to check whether number is prime or not

In that case like take each number let's say 2 and then mark all its multiple as non prime(like0)
Then 3 and mark its multiple as non prime
Continue like this only.


Now other thing is that if we want factors from [i,j] inside sieve.

Then what we can do is like we can first initialise sieve with 1 and now what we can do is like
whenever for example 2 comes I will increment all its multiples by 1.
Now factors from [i,j] will be like A[j] - A[i]

Here A[i] will be prefix sum.
Here A[j] will also be prefix sum.

Question 1

Given a string do permutation of it and like find rank of a string

Like a,b,c 
abc -1
acb -2
bac -3
bca -4
cab -5
cba -6
Here rank of bca is 4.

Question 2

Two pointer question 

Given a sorted array (1,3,5,8,15,20)
Here we have to find values whose sum is equal to a number. (A[i] + A[j] = k)


Question 3
A[i] - A[j] = k

In the above question only if instead of sum difference is equal to k.


Clarifying questions that k is a positive number or not?

Question 1
So the thing is that 
Question is if we make a circle we handover the knife to 1 st person and then he kills second and then handover the knife to the 3 rd person 
So the question is who is the last person who is alive


Question 2
Question is standing at position 0 
The thing is that I can either move k steps forward or k steps backward

Given some coordinate 
Move from position 0 to position x in minimum number of moves
Here like 1 step forward and 1 step backward
2 step forward or 2 step backward
On 3 rd move I can either move 3 step forward or 3 step backward


Question 3
Third question is of randomisation like how many steps we have to do to get two consecutive heads
Learn about getting heads and all
Understand about random variable and expectations always come after random variable
One way is to build a series like start from (1/2*1/2) or (1/2+1/2) like this
Confirm with GPT

Question 4
Letâ€™s say we are giving an interview 
In first place we are giving interview then if one guy is selected 
Then if kth guy will be selected is 1/(k+1)
So the series will become Harmonic progression and it is divergent series
So the answer will be doesn't exist.
Check in which it will exist and in which it will not exist

Question 5
Expected no. Of trials you have to take to get n heads

Question 6
Count inversions i <j and A[i] > A[j]

Question 1

arr = [1,5,8......]

Every element in A occurs twice except one element. Find that element.

Here make two equation sum of numbers from 1 to n and second sum of squares of numbers and solve for two variables.


Question 2

arr = [1,5,8......]

Every element in A occurs thrice except one element which occurs once. Find that element.


Least significant bit is the bit like when we do A&1 and the bit which we do 1 is the least significant bit
Here the time complexity will be n log(N) be sure and ask the difference between ChatGPT of n and N

Quick sort works on average time complexity of n log(n) and what radix sort does is it does/ work on bits so check that 
Here it is n log(N)

Question 3

We have n elements and every single element between 1 to n appears in the array except one element which exist twice 
and one element is missing.

Approach 1
Ek approach thi na jismein negative karte jao ek ek karke wo wali

Approach 2

Given an array A tell there exist two elements and Xor of which is k
A[i]^A[j]=k

Question 4
Given an array 

Part a)
min(A^B)

Part b)
max(A^B)
